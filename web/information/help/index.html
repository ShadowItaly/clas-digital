    <h2>Using the Search-Function</h2>
    <p>A normal search searches in all text body's (ocrs), titles and author names. Thus the search results
may include books, that aren’t scanned yet, or there will be no preview, as the searched word only
matches the name of the author of a book. All search results are sorted by relevance 1 . The search
presents the first ten results showing [Author, title], which is a link to the scan and ocr of the book
(if exists), the bibliography, which links to further details, and a preview presenting a first peep into
the text and where the searched word occurs.</p>

    <h3>Using Advanced Options</h3>
    <p>Using the advanced options allows the user to achieve more accurate results, by choosing a specific
author, date of publication are selecting fuzzy search. I will give a short introduction to the different
use cases. The advanced options will stay selected until the users goes back to the home page
(clicking on “Search”). The search options only apply after redoing the search (clicking the search-
symbol).</p>

    <ul>
    <li>By author:
        <ul>
        <li>Enter an author to only show books by this author.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Collections
        <ul>
        <li>The metadata and all books rely on the zotero database, which is sorted in different
collections.</li>
        <li>The default use case is to search in all collections.</li>
        <li>With the drop-down-menu the user can change this option a search only in “Forschung
Clas” or “Geschichte des Tierwissens” </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Date of publication
        <ul>
        <li>Default case is searching books between 1700 and 2049. The URL mirroring the selected
date, only shows, when one of the values (publicized after or publicized before) differs from
the default. </li>
        <li>The user can select with the drop-down to choose from 1700s, 1800s, etc. but also enter a
custom date (f.e. 1730 – 1750)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Show everything
        <ul>
        <li>The default user case is to show all results. Which means, books with and books without
ocr.
        <li>The user then has the option to select for example only books with text. This might be useful,
if the user plans to do additional research with the text on our website.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>j
    <li>Exact/ Fuzzy Matching
        <ul>
        <li>The standard search is doing a full search, which means it does not match “Jagdhund” when
searching for “Hund” or “Philofophie” (due to bad text detection) when searching for
“Philosophie”. It does however match all other cases and plural/ singular.</li>
        <li>Selecting Fuzzy-Search will find all words containing the searched word and words with a
certain difference to the searched word (using the levenhstein distance).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note, that the typeahead suggestions ignore the selected advanced options. You might become a
word as a suggestion, but the search returns 0 results, as the advanced options filter all matches.</p>

    <h3>Using view Options</h3>
    <p>With the view options the users can change the way the results are viewed, by selecting the amount
of results per page and selecting the way the results are sorted.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Results per page
        <ul>
        <li>Using the drop-down menu the user can decide between showing 10, 20, 50 or all results.</li>
        <li>Using the URL the user can change it to show results starting from a certain result and
custom set the amount of results per page (f.e. start=30 limit=40)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sorting
        <ul>
        <li>The user can select between sorting by relevance (default), alphabetically (name of author)
or chronologically.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Searching for several words</h3>
    <p>By entering f.e. “Nachtigall+Gesang” or “Nachtigall Gesang” it will be searched for both words and
only results are presented where the word occurs on the same page.</p>
