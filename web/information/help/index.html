    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>Searching is possible at <a href="https://www.clas-digital.uni-frankfurt.de/search">www.clas-digital.uni-frankfurt.de/search</a>.  Basic search results use a combination of text bodies (<abbr title="Optical character recognition">OCRs</abbr>, if available), titles and author names.
      All search results are sorted by relevance, most relevant first.
      Search results may include books which have not yet been scanned, where a preview is not possible, and only the title or author match.
      By default pages of ten results at a time, with:
      <ul>
      <li>Author + Title, with a link to the scanned pages and <abbr title="Optical character recognition">OCR</abbr> of the book (if available)</li>
      <li>Bibliography, with links to further details about the book,</li>
      <li>A preview snippet presenting a first look into the text and in which context the searched words occur.</li></ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced search options</h3>
    <p>Advanced search allows restricting to a specific author, date of publication, and fuzzy search.  Advanced options can be reset by performing a brand new search or by clicking on “Search”.  Advanced search options are:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Author
        <ul>
          <li>Only show books by an author(s) with a particular name.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Collections
        <ul>
        <li>Collections are curated sets of books by research subject area.</li>
        <li>By default all books in collections are searched.</li>
        <li>The drop-down-menu allows selecting a single collection; for example <span lang="de">“Forschung
	    Clas”</span> or <span lang="de">“Geschichte des Tierwissens”</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Year of publication
        <ul>
          <li>By default all books are searched (ie. between <time datetime="1700/2049">1700 and 2049</time>).</li>
        <li>Individual links to 1700s, 1800s, are selectable with the drop-down, or an exact range can be entered manually, eg. 1730–1750.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Show everything
        <ul>
        <li>By default all results are shown; including books with, and books without scanned page images or <abbr title="Optical character recognition">OCR</abbr> texts.
        <li>It is possible to restrict results to other scanned books with full-text search; to allow additional research within the full texts available via the CLAS-digital book search.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Exact/Fuzzy Matching
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic search</strong> is restricted to exact partial matches: a search for <span lang="de">“Hund”</span> will match <span lang="de">“Jagdhund”</span>, but <span lang="de">“Philofophie”</span> will not match <span lang="de">“Philosophie”</span>.   Basic search will attempt to match singular/plural and case variations in German-language texts.</li>
          <li><strong>Fuzzy search</strong> will show partial word matches or similiar spelling (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenhstein distance</a>).  These fuzzy search results may take longer to display.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Typeahead suggestions ignore any selected advanced options. This can result in a typehead suggestion showing, but the search itself returnng zero results.  Reset the advanced search options to show more results.</p>

    <h3>More than 10 results per page</h3>
    <p>By default 10 search results are shown at a time; this can be increased by selecting a larger number of results per page.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Results per page
        <ol type="a">
        <li>Results of 10, 20, 50 results per page can be selected with the drop-down menu.</li>
        <li>Manually editing the URL allows any combination of results to be shown; eg. <code><var>start</var>=100</code> and <code><var>limit</var>=42</code> will show 42 results per page, starting from result 100 onwards.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Sorting
        <p>Choices to order search results by relevance (default), alphabetically using surname of author, or chronologically by year.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Searching for several words</h3>
    <p>By entering eg. “<code lang="de">Nachtigall+Gesang</code>” or “<code lang="de">Nachtigall Gesang</code>” multiple word or phrases can be searched for at once.  Snippets preview results are only shown where all words occurs on the same page.</p>
